# Notes on the hierarchy queries

## Possible Future queries:
* Show all of the parents of a child (all the way up)

### Resources
These are some of the pages that I used to help me craft the final queries. ChatGPT also helped. 

(Get all Children - Rercurssive CTE)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67096094/recursive-query-to-get-all-children]
(Show levels)[https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/94932/getting-all-descendants-of-a-parent]
(Parent Child Blog Post)[https://learnsql.com/blog/query-parent-child-tree/] (I found this after I was done, but it looks like it could be helpful. It includes a way to display the hierarchy.)
